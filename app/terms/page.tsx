            Welcome to Red Sea Quest. By accessing or using our website, mobile application, or any of our services, you
            agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing or using Red Sea Quest, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all applicable laws
            and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing
            this site.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Use of Services</h2>
          <p>
            Red Sea Quest provides an online platform that connects travelers with marine tour operators and experiences
            in the Red Sea region. Our services are available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old or have
            legal parental or guardian consent.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Booking and Payments</h2>
          <p>
            When you book an experience through Red Sea Quest, you enter into a contract with the tour operator, not
            with Red Sea Quest. We act as an intermediary between you and the tour operator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment for bookings must be made through our platform using the available payment methods. All prices are
            displayed in USD and include applicable taxes and fees unless otherwise stated.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Cancellation and Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Cancellation and refund policies vary by tour operator and are clearly displayed on each experience listing.
            Please review these policies before making a booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, cancellations made 24 hours or more before the scheduled experience may be eligible for a full
            or partial refund. Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled experience are typically
            non-refundable.
          </p>

            password, and for all activity that occurs under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any

            upon posting on our website. Your continued use of Red Sea Quest after any changes indicates your acceptance
