The only small issue was that it started a bit late, which shortened our time at the second dive site. The staff was apologetic and professional about it. The lunch was good and the boat was comfortable. Would recommend but be prepared for possible delays.",

Highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting the area!",

The underwater experience was nice but not exceptional compared to other diving spots I've visited. Might be worth it for beginners but experienced divers might want to look elsewhere.",
